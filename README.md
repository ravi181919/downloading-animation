# Downloading Animation

This project demonstrates a simple downloading animation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. When the page is loaded, it displays a message "Download Completed.." along with a progress bar animation.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Getting Started
To run this project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## How it Works
- The `index.html` file contains the structure of the webpage, including a title, a message indicating download completion, and a progress bar.
- The `style.css` file contains the styling for the webpage elements, including the positioning and appearance of the download message and progress bar.
- The `script.js` file contains the JavaScript code that animates the progress bar. It uses `setInterval` to increment the width of the progress bar until it reaches 100%, at which point the download message is faded in.

## File Structure
- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the webpage.
- `style.css`: Contains the CSS styling for the webpage.
- `script.js`: Contains the JavaScript code for the animation.
